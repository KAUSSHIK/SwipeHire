# Swipe Hire - A new way to hire and get hired
# The Mobile Application
We plan to make a swipe-based matching app ( like Tinder) to hire candidates for open positions. The hiring manager of a company sees the candidates and chooses who is fit for the next round of interviews. It is a new app for hiring candidates and gets hired.

**Different User Pools and their Roles:**

**Candidates/Job Seekers**

Are able to upload their resume, skills, details, and other relevant information.
Job seekers are allowed to search for companies and apply for specific roles that a company has posted. This would mean that they have demonstrated interest in joining the company.

**Hiring Manager**

Hiring Managers (for a specific role) can see and choose potential candidates who are fit for the role. This is where we will be using a swipe-based matching system like dating apps.
If the manager likes the profile, they can swipe up on it, and an automated message (using WebSockets) or an email will be sent to the candidate. 
Candidates who have shown interest in joining the company will be shown first to the Hiring Manager, and the other profiles will follow.
The manager can also choose to save certain profiles to view later/reconsider or even reject a candidate.

**Company**

This is the user pool that would represent the company. An official from the company would log in with his credentials and would be able to make an about page for the company.
This person would also be able to add a job opening and the Hiring Manager for such a role. If a Hiring Manager is named for the role, that Hiring Manager would be able to add/edit/update the job specifications.
