# Swipe Hire - A new way to hire and get hired
## The Mobile Application
SwipeHire is a swipe-based matching app (like Tinder) made to streamline the recruitment process. The app serves as a portal to hire candidates for open positions. The hiring manager of a company sees the candidates and chooses who is fit for the next round of interviews by 'swiping' on them. Think of it as an offspring of LinkedIn and Tinder

## Features
The first two are mainly to aid the Hiring Manager, and the last one is a brief overview of the features the candidate can access.
### 1) ‚ÜîÔ∏è Swipe Functionality
Hiring Managers will use this new method to üëç 'like', üëé 'dislike', or üîÅ 'save for later' the r√©sum√©s they encounter by means of swiping, just like how you would swipe on profiles on Tinder. This efficient method reduced the time spent on hiring by 40!

### 2) Messaging
What is the point of being liked by a Hiring Manager if you can not schedule an interview? To tackle this issue, our app implemented a real-time messaging technology using WebSockets where the Hiring Manager can reach out to the candidates they 'liked.'

### 3) Candidate Section
Created numerous sections in the app for a candidate to disclose their interests, their about me section, a skills assessments section, and a page where the candidate can like/show interest in companies and search for jobs based on location, salary, and position.
